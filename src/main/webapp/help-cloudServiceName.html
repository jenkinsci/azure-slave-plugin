By default, Jenkins uses the template name as the cloud service name.
Enter a value if you want to overwrite the default cloud service name.
The limit for VMs in a single service is 50, so multiple cloud service names may be entered as a comma-separated list.
     
Jenkins will create a new cloud service if one does not exists already. </br></br>
	
Rules for the cloud service name:</br>
1. The name must start with an alphanumeric and can contain only alphanumerics and the dash (-) character. </br>
2. Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by an alphanumeric; consecutive dashes are not permitted.</br>
3. The name length must be between 3 and 63 characters.</br>
